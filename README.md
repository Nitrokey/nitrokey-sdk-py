# Nitrokey Python SDK

The Nitrokey Python SDK can be used to use and configure Nitrokey devices.

## Features

The SDK supports these devices and features:

- Nitrokey 3
  - device and bootloader management (`nitrokey.nk3`)
  - admin app (`nitrokey.trussed.admin_app`)
  - provisioner app (`nitrokey.trussed.provisioner_app`)
  - secrets app (`nitrokey.nk3.secrets_app`)
- Nitrokey Passkey
  - device and bootloader management (`nitrokey.nkpk`)
  - admin app (`nitrokey.trussed.admin_app`)
  - provisioner app (`nitrokey.trussed.provisioner_app`)

## Installation

The Nitrokey Python SDK is released to the [Python Package Index][pypi] (PyPI) and can be installed with `pip`:

[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/nitrokey/

```
$ pip install nitrokey
```

The releases are also available as [signed tags][releases] in the GitHub repository [Nitrokey/nitrokey-sdk-py][github].

[releases]: https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-sdk-py/releases
[github]: https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-sdk-py

## Getting Started

```python
from nitrokey.nk3 import NK3
from nitrokey.nkpk import NKPK

print("Connected Nitrokey devices:")
for device in NK3.list():
    print(f"- {device.name} at {device.path}")
for device in NKPK.list():
    print(f"- {device.name} at {device.path}")
```

## Compatibility

The Nitrokey Python SDK currently requires Python 3.9 or later.
Support for old Python versions may be dropped in minor releases.

## Development

The following software is required for the development of the SDK:

- Python 3.9 or newer
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- GNU Make
- git

After checking out the source code from GitHub, you can install the SDK and its dev dependencies into a new virtual environment managed by poetry using `make install`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-sdk-py.git
$ cd nitrokey-sdk-py
$ make install
```

We use multiple checks and linters for this project.
Use `make check` to run all required checks.
Some problems can automatically be fixed by running `make fix`.

The SDK also includes minimal tests to ensure that it is installed and loaded correctly.
Use `make test` to run these tests.

### Dependency Management

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management.
poetry maintains a lockfile with pinned dependency versions that is used for development environments and in CI.
This lockfile includes the hash of the `pyproject.toml` file, so it needs to be updated if `pyproject.toml` is changed.
These make targets can be used to invoke poetry for the most common tasks:

- `make install` installs the SDK and its dependencies as specified in the lockfile (must be up-to-date)
- `make lock` updates the lockfile without changing pinned dependency versions
- `make update` bumps all dependencies, installs them and updates the lockfile

For more information, see poetryâ€™s documentation on [Managing depencies](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-dependencies/) and [Commands](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/).

### Publishing Releases

Releases are published using Github Actions.
To create a new release:
1. Update the `version` field in `pyproject.toml` manually or using `poetry version`.
2. Update the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for the release.
3. Run `make update-version` to update the RPM package version.
4. Commit these changes, create a PR and merge into `main`.
5. Create a signed tag with the version number and a `v` prefix, for example `v0.2.4`, and push it to this repository.
6. [Create a new release](https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-sdk-py/releases/new) for this tag and copy the relevant parts from the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) to the release description.
7. Wait for the deployment action to run and approve the deployment to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/p/nitrokey).

All commits to `main` are automatically deployed to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/p/nitrokey).
It is also possible to publish release candidates (pre-releases) with a suffix like `-rc.1`.
